This tweak should be compatible with iOS 10 - iOS 13, but was only tested on iOS 13.3.
Please report any issues to the [GitHub issues section](https://github.com/JeffResc/SongShare/issues) if it does not work on one of these versions.

## About
SongShare is an iOS tweak that will automatically detect when you’ve copied a music URL to your clipboard and will automatically convert them to a [SongLink](https://odesli.co/) (or [SongWhip](https://songwhip.com/)). This allows you to easily share this new link with friends, who will be able to open the link and choose their streaming service of choice to open the song (or album) in.
